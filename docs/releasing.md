# Release Instructions

This document outlines the process for creating new releases of ChatMcp.

## Release Process

1. **Prepare for Release**
   - Ensure all desired changes are merged into the main branch
   - Update version numbers in relevant files
   - Update changelog if applicable

2. **Create and Push a Release Tag**
   ```bash
   # Ensure you're on the main branch
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main

   # Create a new tag
   git tag v1.0.0  # Replace with your version number

   # Push the tag
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

3. **GitHub Actions Automation**
   The tag push will automatically trigger the release workflow which:
   - Builds the application for all platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows)
   - Creates platform-specific packages:
     - Linux: `chatmcp-linux-x64.tar.gz`
     - macOS: `chatmcp-macos-x64.dmg`
     - Windows: `chatmcp-windows-x64.zip`
   - Creates a GitHub release with these packages

4. **Monitor the Build**
   - Go to the GitHub Actions tab in the repository
   - Monitor the "Build and Release" workflow
   - Ensure all platforms build successfully

5. **Verify the Release**
   After the workflow completes:
   - Go to the Releases page on GitHub
   - Verify that all artifacts are present
   - Check that the packages can be downloaded
   - Test the packages on respective platforms if possible

1. Go to the GitHub Actions tab
2. Select the "Build and Release" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
